# About

This is a disassembly of Pokémon Red and Blue.
It has been modified to allow Hebrew language compatibility,
and is in the process of being translated into Hebrew.

If you'd like to contribute Hebrew translations, please do contact
me either or on Discord (I'm Nog#4061) for a short style guide (style guide
link TBA).

# Credit


Code for Hebrew compatibility used to be from
[**LIJI32**](https://github.com/LIJI32)'s old modification on top
of pokered, called [pokeadom](https://github.com/LIJI32/pokeadom).\
Almost none of LIJI32's code is used currently, but this project still utilizes many of the changes he made (that aren't code per-se).

Thanks so much to Eyal Seelig (link TBA) for porting LIJI32's
6-year-old for the still-currently-updating pokered.

Hebrew translations of Pokemon names are from the wonderful כיסלצות project by Michael Elboim.\

### Shameless to-do list

These are to be done after translation has been fully completed. For now, I'd like to focus on translation first.

[ ] Add player gender choice and player gender pronouns\
[ ] Add enemy trainer gendered pronouns\
[ ] Adjust mon-related text to be as gender neutral as possible
